  "course_description": "Citizen participation is everywhere. Invoking it has become _de rigueur_ when discussing cities and regions in the developing world.

While it is clear that participation cannot possibly \"do\" all that is claimed, it is also clear that citizen participation cannot be dismissed, and that there must be something to it. Figuring out what that something is \u2014 whether it is identifying the types of participation or the contexts in which it happens that bring about desirable outcomes \u2014 is the goal of the class.\n",
